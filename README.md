rna-transcription

A simple Java applicaiton determines and returns the RNA complement (as a String) of a given DNA sequence entered (as a String).

About the project

This rna-transcription is a simple Java program created to practice and improve on my programming and problem solving skills. This is not a program which solves a real-world problem (for now).

This is a project inspired 100% on a java exercise found on exercism.org with the name RNA Transcription. This project is my implementation of this exercise. The exercise can be found here: https://exercism.org/tracks/java/exercises/rna-transcription

The program's purpose is to Here's part of the exercise instruction which justifies the purpuse of the program (creating a very specific molecule called a micro-RNA, which prevents the excessive production of a given protein):

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:

G -> C
C -> G
T -> A
A -> U

## Features
- Get the RNA strand complent of a given DNA strand.


## Technolies Used
- Java 17
- IntelliJ IDEA
